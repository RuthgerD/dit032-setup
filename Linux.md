# Linux

You probably know what you need to do anyways, but here is a compacted guide to not waste your time :)

## PostgreSQL
### Installation
**Ubuntu**
```
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
**Arch**
```
sudo pacman -S postgresql
```
**Fedora**
```
sudo dnf install postgresql postgresql-server
```
### Setup
Once installed make check if the postgresql server is running (or at least exists) with:
```
systemctl status postgresql
```
If it is not active use the following command to have it automatically start:
```
sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql
```
If it fails, don't worry we need to some configuration first.  
Login and start a shell with the following command:
```
sudo -i -u postgres
```
In case the `systemctl enable` command failed, run this command to properly initialize a database file:
```
initdb -D /var/lib/postgres/data
```
Go ahead and rerun the systemctl command above.

Now we have to create a user with the following command:
```
createuser --interactive
```
It will ask for a username, if you input your linux username it will automatically grant you access with subsequent commands.  
note: you can safely ignore usernames and passwords referenced in other documents this way.

Go ahead and exit the postgre user shell:
```
exit
```
Finally we will create a database:
```
createdb myDatabaseName
```
And to verify everything works we open an interactive shell:
```
psql myDatabaseName
```
and then type `quit` to exit again

See the specific [PostgreSQL instructions](/PostgreSQL.md) for further information.

## MongoDB

### Installation
**Ubuntu <= 20.04**

Simply install from the official repos:
```
sudo apt install mongodb mongo-tools
```

**Ubuntu 20.10**

As of Ubuntu 20.10 the mongodb package has been dropped from the official repos due to licensing, and thus a seperate PPA has to be added:
```
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
and
```
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
```
Then update and install mongodb:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mongodb-org
```
_note: if you have upgraded from earlier versions make sure to remove
/var/lib/mongodb and /var/log/mongodb before the installation._

**Arch**

The AUR has a pre-build which can be installed with any AUR helper.
```
yay -S aur/mongodb-bin aur/mongodb-tools-bin
```
**Fedora**

Due to licensing Fedora chose not to include MongoDB in their repositories. So an additional step is required to get it installed.

```
sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb.repo
```

Copy paste this piece of text:
```
[mongodb-upstream]
name=MongoDB Upstream Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/8Server/mongodb-org/4.4/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc
```
Key sequence to save and quit:
ctrl+x -> Y -> Enter

Then install as normal
```
sudo dnf install mongodb-org
```

### Setup
Once installed make sure the mongodb server is running (or at least exists) with:
```
systemctl status mongodb
```

If its not active use the following command to have it automatically start:
```
sudo systemctl enable --now mongodb
```
Repeat `systemctl status mongodb` to make sure it is in fact running this time.

note: the service file depends on your distribution, on Arch its `mongodb` and on Fedora/Ubuntu 20.10 its `mongod`.

Then run the mongo command to open the interactive shell
```
mongo
```
If everything went well you can type  
```
> quit()
```

to exit.

If it errors out saying the connection failed, reboot and try again.
